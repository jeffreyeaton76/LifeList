App for tracking bird sightings

This app allows users to create an account and keep track of birds they have seen. Required fields for making a post include bird seen, where seen, when seen, a url to a picture of the bird (any public image; uploading images may or may not be implemented) and field notes. 

The app is built with Ruby on Rails. The app is currently in production.
