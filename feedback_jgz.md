​
## Technical Requirements
​
**Performing**: nice work adding in 3 models here! users, posts, and comments, great job. Maybe a next step here could be finding some sort of external API for information on birds. So if a user adds one, the API will pull in additional info on the specific bird?
​
## Creativity and Interface
​
**Performing**: Really like the styling you've done with this! the layout looks great, and I'm super into the use of the sidebar. I think the next step here would be to start working on responsiveness. I've added in a few comments to the css file as well!
​
## Code Quality
​
**Performing**: Overall very few issues, as is evident by the well function app. I've added in some comments, specifically in the controllers and view files, that should help give you some ideas for DRYing it up and cleaning some other parts.
​
## Deployment and Functionality
​
**Performing**: Great job here Jeff! Looks like things deployed properly, and the functionality is really coming along. I'm impressed with the hand-rolled user model, and adding in validations that stop people from commenting without being signed in.
​
## Planning / Process / Submission
​
**Performing**: The planning looks great! I would encourage you to use your README.md file a little more too.  So, adding in installation instructions (bundle install, rake commands, etc), as well as things like extra gems used, and other little anecdotes. Everything else was submitted on time and looks really good. Well done!
